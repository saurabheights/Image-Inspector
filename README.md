# Image-Inspector
A pycharm plugin to inspect images.

The current state of the plugin involves checking if the user has right-clicked on a numpy array variable in the debugger and displaying an "Inspect image" option. It successfully retrieves the numpy array data for 2D arrays. However, it encounters a crash when the number of dimensions is not equal to 2.
